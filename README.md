# Overview

This is a simple C# console app that outputs "Hello World" programme using C#. While the functionality is basic, it serves as an fundamental introduction to working with the .Net environment

The purpose of creating this software is to strengthen my foundational understanding of how C# applications run within the .NET ecosystem. Building this project helped me learn how to set up a new console app, manage files using Visual Studio Code, and use the dotnet run command to execute programs. It’s a first step toward mastering C# syntax, object-oriented programming, and the overall software development workflow using .NET.
